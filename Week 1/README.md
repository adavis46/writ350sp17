# Week 1  
**January 23-28**
Welcome to Digital Writing. This semester marks the first time WRIT 350 is offered online. As such, you get to experience an experimental course that is probably a lot different from courses you've taken before. I want you to learn new ways of composing and communicating information, and this course will probably challenge you. However, I am here to make sure you succeed, and if we work together, I think this new course will be really great.
