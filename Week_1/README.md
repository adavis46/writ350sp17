# Week 1  
**January 23-28**  
Welcome to Digital Writing. This semester marks the first time WRIT 350 is offered online. As such, you get to experience an experimental course that is probably a lot different from courses you've taken before. I want you to learn new ways of composing and communicating information, and this course will probably challenge you. However, I am here to make sure you succeed, and if we work together, I think this new course will be really great.

    * [Blackboard](http://blackboard.olemiss.edu)
    * [Blogs](http://edblogs.olemiss.edu)
    * [Slack](https://writ350sp17.slack.com/)
* Introduce "digital writing" as a concept and review syllabus/course projects 
* Begin work for Project 1: Information Design

> The video, "A Vision of Students Today," is now almost 9 years old. Do you think its message still rings true? For your first blog entry, write about your "vision of students today." Consider the following questions: 

> * What is the role of collaboration in your day-to-day experience as a student? 
> * Which technologies do you rely upon for your school work? 
> * Which ones do you rely on for your personal life? 
> * Is there any overlap? What do you think a "vision of students" today will be in 8 more years?

> Your post should be around 250 words.

## Discussion and Activities 
1. Study the [University of Mississippi website](http://olemiss.edu). Focus on three measures of excellence in technical communication: clarity, accessibility, and professional appearance (based on Ch 1 of PSTC). How effectively does the UM home page meet each of these measures of excellence? In the Blackboard discussion forum, post your findings. be sure to address each of the three measures. Respond to at least one of your classmates' posts by the end of the week.
