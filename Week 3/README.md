## Deliverables 
1. Assemble an annotated bibliography of sources for project #1. Your project should use no fewer than 3 and no more than 5 credible, rigorous sources for evidence and support. These sources do not have to be "academic" in the sense that they come from traditional peer-reviewed journals, but you must argue for their credibility in each annotation.  

Each annotation must include the following: 
* Complete citation of the source (I don't have a preference for style guide, but be consistent)
* Summary of the source's purpose, audience, and message
* Explanation of how the source applies to your project 
* Argument for source credibility (what characteristics of the source give it *ethos*?)

2. Compose a blog entry to the following prompt: 

> Review the four additional texts for this week and answer the question "Is Google Making us Stupid?" -- What are the tradeoffs we face as members of a networked society? Is internet addiction a real thing? What are we losing as we move towards an entirely digital existence? 

> This question is designed to make you think outside the box. The NPR story about preserving wax cylinder portents the future: What do we lose when we listen to music on Spotify instead of buying a physical copy of a song? What do we gain? Are physical books really as important to literacy, or are we just being nostalgic?  

Your post should be about 300 words. 

## Discussion and Activities 
1. For each of the following questions, select a research technique that is likely to yield a useful answer. For instance, if the question is "Which companies within a 20-mile radius of our company headquarters sell recycled paper?" a search of the web is likely to provide a useful answer. 

* Does the Honda CRV include traction control as a standard feature?
* How much money has our company's philanthropic foundation donated to colleges and universities in each of  the last three years?
* How does a 3d printer work? 
* Could our building 3 support a rooftop green space?
* How can we determine whether we would save more money by switching to LED lighting in our corporate offices?  

Remember you don't need to actually answer these questions. Just choose the best research technique for finding the answer.
