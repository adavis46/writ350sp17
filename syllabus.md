## Required Texts
Mike Markel. (2016). *Practical Strategies for Technical Communication.* 2nd Edition. New York: Bedford/St. Martins.
ISBN: [9781319003364](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Strategies-Technical-Communication-Markel/dp/1319003362)

## Course Description
This course introduces fundamental concepts of the demands of writing for electronic audiences across a variety of platforms, with an emphasis on the interaction of the medium and the message. Writing 350 bridges the study of technical communication practice with Web 2.0 technologies and New Media composition. Students in this course will develop the vocabulary and practical skills to create, collaborate on, and deliver digital documents in a variety of media to real audiences and users. They will also build upon the rhetorical skills developed in Writing 250 by engaging in more sophisticated, deliverable-based research writing projects.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of WRIT 350, students will progress in the following areas:
*Process*
* Recognize that digital composition and communication is process-based and situation-specific
* Develop heuristics for approaching and solving digital communication challenges that may occur in a variety of media

*Exploration*
* Understand key terms and concepts, such as “digital writing,” “technical communication,” “new media,” and “user experience.”
* Apply theoretical models to real-world communication scenarios and user experiences.

*Purpose and Audience*
* Understand how to construct profiles for digital audiences and users of information.
* Develop information and content that adheres to the principles of universal design

*Research*
* Use an inquiry-driven approach to identify key issues and topics in the fields of digital composition and technical communication
* Utilize a variety of primary and secondary sources of information to support project deliverables 

*Conventions and Mechanics*
* Deliver written products that are precise and free of mechanical errors that inhibit meaning.
* Design content that is universally accessible and adaptable from the concept stage to the execution stage.

## Course Logistics

### Attendance Polocy 
Although our class does not meet face-to-face due to its online format, active participation is expected and required. Being an active participant in the class means that if you were not a member of the class the quality of the class would be noticeably affected (e.g., through the absence of your contributions to online discussion forums, participation in peer review, etc.).

The university requires **active participation** during the first week of an online class in order to verify student attendance. You must complete the first week’s activities to avoid being administratively withdrawn from the course.

### Attendance for Students on Scholarship
If a student is attending UM with a scholarship requiring course absences (e.g, athletics, band), the following exception applies: students will not be penalized for required absences alone, as long as the student presents to the instructor by the end of the course drop/add period an official letter from the scholarship-issuing program declaring the required absences for the entire semester. Students whose scholarship-issuing programs cannot produce such a letter, or determine a schedule in advance, should take the course during another semester. Letters cannot be amended. Students on scholarship who plan to miss 10% of the course should enroll in the course during another semester.

### Standard Withdrawal
The deadline for withdrawal with tuition refund is 2/3. The deadline for withdrawal with the possibility of a “W” grade is 3/3.

### Hardship Withdrawal
Students suffering traumatic hardships (hospitalization, emergency service, etc.) should promptly consult section VI of the M-Book for procedures on contacting the Dean of Students.

### Special Needs
If you have a documented disability as described by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (P.L. 933-112 Section 504) or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and would like to request academic and/or physical accommodations, please contact Student Disability Services at 234 Martindale Center, 662-915-7128. Course requirements will not be waived but reasonable accommodations may be provided as appropriate. Please consult [the SDS website](http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/sds/) for more information on student disability services.

### Academic Honesty
All work that you submit under your name for credit at UM is assumed to be your original work. While teachers hope and expect for you to incorporate the thinking of others in your work, you must credit others’ work when you rely upon it. In your written assignments, there are only three methods for properly importing the work of others: quotation, paraphrase, and summary.

The penalty for plagiarism in Writing 350 may include an “F” on the assignment, an “F” in the course, suspension or expulsion from the university, or other sanctions. Upon determining plagiarism, the instructor will notify the student and the Chair of the Department of Writing and Rhetoric in writing. The instructor will also make a recommendation for the penalty he/she finds most appropriate for the offense. Students may appeal the instructor’s finding and/or recommended penalty by notifying the UM Academic Discipline Committee within 14 days of the instructor’s decision.

The applicable full UM policy is ACA.AR.600.001 and should be consulted by any student concerned with plagiarism. Broadly speaking, plagiarism is completely avoidable: if you are ever uncertain whether or not you are committing plagiarism, ask your instructor.

### University Writing Centers:
Aside from one-on-one meetings with teachers during office hours, the best way to improve your writing is to work with writing consultants at one of the University’s Writing Centers. On the Oxford campus, the writing center is on the 3rd floor of the Lamar building. Writing consultants will work with any student writer working on any project in any discipline. To learn more about Writing Center locations, hours, scheduling and services, please go to [the Writing Centers website](http://rhetoric.olemiss.edu/writing-centers/).

Make contact with a Writing Center consultant early and often. Working with a writing consultant is easy, and you have access to face-to-face and online sessions. To make an appointment with a writing consultant, go to [the online scheduler](http://olemiss.mywconline.com) and follow the instructions. You may also upload a draft of your paper once you have made the reservation for a session. If you want to see how an online session works, a how-to video is available for students.

Many successful students begin going to the Writing Center with their first essay and continue working with the writing center over the course of a semester, making appointments with writing consultants for each essay they write. The goal of the Writing Center is to help students become better, independent writers, so the writing consultants don’t “proofread” or merely “correct” errors. Instead, they do something better – they will help you to brainstorm, talk about research and explore resources, and help you improve your editing strategies. Remember, online appointments are available. If you have questions about the writing center, use the LiveChat tool on our website to talk with someone in the writing center, call us at 662-915-7689, or send email to [cwrwc@go.olemiss.edu](mailto:cwrwc@go.olemiss.edu).

### Library Resources
University Librarians are available to help you find and evaluate sources for your papers. Go to the [library website](http://www.libraries.olemiss.edu/uml/) and click on “Ask A Librarian” for help via live chat, email, and phone. Librarians are available at the Reference Desk on first floor in the Information Commons.

### Grades
A grade of “D” or better is necessary to pass this class.

Letter Grade Equivalency
----------|--------------
A  93-100 | C+  77-79
A-  90-92 | C   73-76
B+  87-89 | C-  70-72
B   83-86 | D   65-69
B-  80-82 | F   64-below

### Extensions
I am happy to grant extensions on **major assignments** if I receive a written request at least 24 hours in advance of the deadline. I will not consider extensions for non-deliverable assignments or drafts. 
Revise and Resubmit

If you receive a grade lower than 80% on a major assignment, you may revise and resubmit it. You must write a proposal that lists specific aspects of the assignment that you will change (this list must go beyond the feedback you get from me). **Revise and resubmit proposals are due 5 business days after you receive a grade on an assignment. You will then have one week (7 days) to complete your revision.** The new grade will replace the original grade.
