Assemble an annotated bibliography of sources for project #1. Your project should use no fewer than 3 and no more than 5 credible, rigorous sources for evidence and support. These sources do not have to be "academic" in the sense that they come from traditional peer-reviewed journals, but you must argue for their credibility in each annotation.  

Each annotation must include the following: 
* Complete citation of the source (I don't have a preference for style guide, but be consistent)
* Summary of the source's purpose, audience, and message
* Explanation of how the source applies to your project 
* Argument for source credibility (what characteristics of the source give it *ethos*?)
