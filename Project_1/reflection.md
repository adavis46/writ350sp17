Compose the reflection as a 300-500 word memo. You may use this assignment description as a format guide. Your reflection memo should address the following:

* Color
* Proximity/Layout of elements
* Alignment
* Typography
* Use of visuals/graphics
* Consistency and contrast of elements 
* Overall length of the infographic 
* Visual integration of source citations 

You aren’t limited to these, and you obviously don’t have to explain every single design choice in this memo. Focus on the choices you found most relevant. As a part of this section, write about at least one design element that gave you trouble, and how you addressed that concern in your design. 

**Visual Rhetoric**
Think about the purpose and audience of your infographic. Given the assignment’s stated audience of undergraduate students, in what ways does your infographic specifically address this audience? Did any of your design choices specifically reflect that audience? What was challenging about designing for this particular audience? 

Also consider the purpose of the infographic. Does the message of your infographic match the medium? Given the content you included, and the design choices you made, is “infographic” the best way to package your message and deliver it to your audience? If you were to change the medium, for example, what elements of your message would have to change? 

**Peer Feedback** 
Finally, consider the feedback you received from me and from your peers in designing the infographic. Write about at least one piece of feedback that you received from a peer, and discuss you would have made in your design based on their feedback. You can also talk about whether viewing your peers’ infographics influenced your own design in any way.
